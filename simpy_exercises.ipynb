    "SimPy is a discrete-event simulation library used to simulate complex systems that involve interactions between components or entities. It is particularly useful in simulating real-world problems that require complex scheduling, resource allocation, and event handling.\n",

    "Some of the key features of SimPy include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Processes and events are discrete, meaning they happen at specific points in time.\n",
    "    - https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topical_guides/events.html\n",
    "- Resources can be defined and allocated to processes, and released when no longer needed.\n",
    "    - https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topical_guides/resources.html#the-basic-concept-of-resources\n",
    "- Multiple processes can run concurrently and interact with each other.\n",
    "    - https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topical_guides/process_interaction.html\n",
    "- Simulation results can be easily analyzed and visualized.\n",
    "- SimPy can be used to model and simulate a wide range of systems, including traffic flow, manufacturing processes, supply chains, and more."
